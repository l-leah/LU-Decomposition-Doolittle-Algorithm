# LU-Decomposition-Doolittle-Algorithm
Solve matrices using LU Decomposition by Doolittle algorithm without Gaussian Elimination process.

LU Decomposition factorizes a square matrix into a lower triangular matrix (L) and an upper triangular matrix (U), such that the original matrix can be represented as the product of these two triangular matrices. This technique is often used to simplify solving systems of linear equations and finding determinants.

The Doolittle Algorithm is a specific method for performing LU Decomposition, where the diagonal elements of the lower triangular matrix (L) are set to 1, and the other elements of L and U are determined through a systematic process of eliminating entries to create the factorized form.

1) Input the number of size of square matrix A
2) Input the number of value for each element in matrix A
3) Input the value of constant term/s

Result will display the created matrix A, L and U Decomposition, and x and y values.
